# GitHub Instructions

After creating your repository on GitHub, run the following commands to push your code:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/cvmodifier.git

# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up with GitHub)

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote using SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/cvmodifier.git

# Push the main branch to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## What to do after pushing

1. Go to your repository on GitHub to confirm the code has been pushed successfully
2. Set up GitHub Pages or another deployment platform to view your site online
3. Share the repository URL with others who might want to contribute to or use your project
